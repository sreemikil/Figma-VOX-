![Figma Co-pilot Gif Example](https://github.com/AkshayBenny/figma-copilot/blob/386572a252a7a68cacee6ee0458231e6377f3546/assets/demogif.gif)



Figma Vox is a voice-activated virtual design assistant that will be primarily available on Figma as a third-party plugin capable of customising your design experience or creating more efficient workflows in Figma or Figma Jam files.

Users/Designers interact with Figma Vox using natural voice. Figma Vox can create UI designs based on voice commands given by the designer. Initially this feature of speech recognition will be available only in English, but in the future it will be able to support multiple languages and engage in two-way conversations, proposing real-time design recommendations based on industry standards/brand guidelines.

In short, Figma Vox provides voice commands that allow you to complete a variety of design tasks. It is intended to provide the user/designer with conversational interactions in order to create a UI (even from scratch)

## What does Figma Co-pilot check for by default?
Out of the box, Figma Co-pilot only checks for guideline and layout erros in each layer. In Figma, the best practice is to use styles and proper naming (also referred to as design tokens) on all of your layers, so your type, colors, spacing etc are all consistent and it will help the developer easily identify the elements and components.

That being said, Figma Co-pilot is ready for you to write custom rules for your team. For example, if you wanted to ensure that no text layers are using background specific colors, you can check out the example is provided below.
